npm i typescript -g
npm i lite-server

app.ts code compiled to Javascript app.js file

Run in 2 terminals: first, npm start
                    second, tsc --init & after that tsc fileName --watch or tsc
                    
To initialize tsconfig.json file: tsc --init

CLASSES & INTERFACES:
- Singleton Pattern: Ensuring that there is one instance of certain class 

Interafce: Structure of an object

- U can implement an interface in a class
- U can implement multiple interfaces than inheritance which can extend only 1 class

- IF WORKING WITH INTERFACES, THEN WE CAN'T USE INSTANCEOF

GENERICS

A generic type is a type which is kind of connected with some other type & is really flexible regarding which exact type that other type is. 

DECORATORS

A decorator is a function & u can find it either with a function decoration or as a function expression

U can add more than 1 decorators to the same class 
Execution of decorators happens from bottom to top
We don't have to add all decorators directly to the class 

  // VOID TELLS THE TS THAT THIS IS A FUNCTION WHICH HAS ATLEAST A BRANCH WHICH DOES NOT RETURN ANY VALUE
  // USING VOID: BOTH POSSIBILITY EITHER RETURN NOTHING OR RETURN TUPLE


MODULE NAMESPACES
Namespaces can also be used to structure code into modules, allowing for better organization and maintainability of larger codebases. 

WEBPACK
Webpack is a tool that will help us bundle our files together 
- It is a bundling & build orchestration tool
- Its a tool that help us reduce the amount of HTTP requests by bundling code together. So that we write code split up across multiple files but webpack then takes all these files & bundles them together 

- It will also optimize our code & allows us to add more build steps, more build tools


npm i yarn
yarn init
yarn create react-app my-app --typescript


NOTE: 
  tsc app.ts => node app.js      : This will run
  node app.ts                    : Node can also run Ts file, node doesn't matter abt the extension it runs any file with any extension with simple code 

  But node is not capable of parsing & compiling Ts, using TS features it won't work but using JS it works
